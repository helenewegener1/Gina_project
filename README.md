B cells 

## Data 
Human samples. 


HH117 is a patient with Crohns Disease where tissue have been taken from a inflamed (INF) and non-inflamed (nonINF) site.

HH119 is a patient with Colorectal Cancer where the sample have been taken from a non-tumor cite and is therefore used as the best healthy control we can get.

The samples from SI-PP are separated into follicles that each are labeled with a hashtag.

### Patient 
HH117: patient with Crohns Disease (CD)

HH119: patient with Colorectal Cancer (CRC) ~ Control 

### Inflammation Status
nonINF: non-inflamed

INF: inflamed 

### Library Types (Sequencing Data)

TCR: T cell receptor 


### Sites in the Intestine
SI-PP: Small Intestine - Peyer's Patch

SI-MILF: Small Intestine - Muscularis layer of the Intestinal Lamina Fibrinogen-rich area

SILP: Small Intestine - Lamina Propria

COLP: Colon - Lamina Propria

CO-SMILF: Colon - Submucosal layer or Muscularis layer of the Intestinal Lamina Fibrinogen-rich area

### Cell Types
CD19: Cluster of Differentiation 19 (Marker for B-cells)

GC: Germinal Center (B-cells)

TFH: T Follicular Helper (T-cells)

PB: Plasmablast

HLADR: Human Leukocyte Antigen – DR isotype (MHC Class II molecule)

PC: Plasma Cell

## Structure of analysis 
fastq files on computerome: /home/projects/dtu_00062/data/KU09/FASTQ_ku09_mkfastq/outs/fastq_path/HKL3YDSXF
00_data: Excel files with information about hashtag antibodies from each 
01_prep_feature_ref: Using the excel files in 00_data to make feature_ref files for each hashtag-combination. 
02_prep_fastq: fastq files are copied from the original directory into a structure where all fastq files from the same sample are in one folder. This might not be needed anyways...
03_prep_references: Download human genome reference and human vdj reference for B and T cell receptors. 
04_prep_config: From self-made template files, there is created a config file per sample depending on which files exist for the given sample. 
05_run_cellranger: Running cellranger multi using the config files.

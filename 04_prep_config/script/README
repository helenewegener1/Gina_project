For now the path to the fastq files is the original path: /home/projects/dtu_00062/data/KU09/FASTQ_ku09_mkfastq/outs/fastq_path/HKL3YDSXF
If we decided to go with the folder structure made in 02_prep_fastq; change path to libraries to:

[libraries]
fastq_id,fastqs,feature_types
GEX-SAMPLE_PREFIX,/home/people/helweg/ciir/people/helweg/projects/Gina_project/02_prep_fastq/out/GEX-SAMPLE_PREFIX,Gene Expression
BCR-SAMPLE_PREFIX,/home/people/helweg/ciir/people/helweg/projects/Gina_project/02_prep_fastq/out/BCR-SAMPLE_PREFIX,VDJ-B
TCR-SAMPLE_PREFIX,/home/people/helweg/ciir/people/helweg/projects/Gina_project/02_prep_fastq/out/TCR-SAMPLE_PREFIX,VDJ-T
ADT-SAMPLE_PREFIX,/home/people/helweg/ciir/people/helweg/projects/Gina_project/02_prep_fastq/out/ADT-SAMPLE_PREFIX,Antibody Capture
